# post-my-api

A tiny toolkit that generates Markdown docs using the postman collection v2.1

Example:

```bash
node index -f example/colln.json -t example
```

Supports only Collection schema v2.1, collections present in nested folders also works fine!
I just worked with `JSON` format, feel free to test it and contribute :)
