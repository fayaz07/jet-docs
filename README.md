# post-my-api

A tiny toolkit that generates Markdown docs using the postman collection v2.1

usage:

```bash
node index -f example/colln.json -t example
```

check the example [here](example/docs/post-my-api.md)

Supports only Collection schema v2.1, collections present in nested folders also works fine!
I just worked with `JSON` format, feel free to test it and contribute :)

- eslint-config-prettier
- swagger for colors and which drove me to develop this plugin instead of re-writing everything everytime
